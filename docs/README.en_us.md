# Change Farm Cave - Stardew Valley
﻿
## Intro and Usage

Please copy the program “ChangeFarmCave.exe” into the save folder you want to modify. If your Farm Cave is already set to Mushroom or Bat, running the program will change it to the other type and back up your save.

Note: The program only works on common Windows platforms (supports PowerShell 5.1). If your save is on an Android device or other operating systems, please transfer the save file to a Windows device for processing, and then transfer it back to the original device after the modification is complete. This feature only works for farm caves that have not been modified by other mods.
