# Change Farm Cave - Stardew Valley
﻿
## Intro and Usage

The script will check your Farm Cave type and ask if you want to change it to another type (Bat or Mushroom); 
Please copy the script files "script.ps1" and "START.bat" to the save folder you want to operate, and then run "START.bat". The save processing will take effect permanently and generate a backup with a ".bak" suffix. Afterwards, you can either delete the mod or modify it multiple times.

Note that the mod can only be operated on the Windows platform (or operating systems supporting PowerShell 5.1). If your save is located on an Android phone or other operating system, please send the save file to a Windows device for operation, and then transfer it back to the original device after processing is complete.
